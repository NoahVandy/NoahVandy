# Project Showcase
- CollegeTrade - is my Senior Capstone. It is a virtual marketplace for students at Grand Canyon University to buy, sell, and trade things safely between other students. You need to have a GCU issued email in order to sign up and view listings other students have posted. Students can also set up different shops that contain specific types of listings they choose. This specific project uses the **MERN Stack** all hosted on **AWS**.
- CollegeTradeMobile - is an extention of my Senior Captsone. It uses the same API and Database, but uses **React-Native** as the front end, throwing me into the world of iOS/ Andriod development
- [TRP Productions](https://www.trp.productions) - a simple HTML website that I created for a friend's photography business.
