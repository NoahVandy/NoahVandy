### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me
My full name is **Noah Vandervelden** but I usually shorten it to Vandy so it's easier for people to remember ðŸ¤·. I am current a Software Engineer 2 at Cox Automotive with a degree in Computer Programming. This degree focuses not only on the coding aspect of development, but the design and agile components as well. Over the course of my college career, I have learned OOP through Java, C#, and PHP. Along with those languages, I have learned Java Spring, .NET MVC, and Laravel. I was taught design principles like UML class diagrams, system design, flowcharts, etc... 

I've worked in the UI/UX space at Cox for over 2 years, leading my team in front-end development and being mentored by the current Principal Engineers in my organization. I've had two Software Engineering internships. One was at a startup called Simplifyy, and the other was at a Forutne 500 company called Cerner. In these internships I learned how to communicate with a development team, how to participate in agile ceremonies, and contribute clean and effective code. Through Simplifyy I was taught React.js and Express.js, while at Cerner I was taught Ruby and Rails.

I love working with apps / websites that have a focus for UI/UX, codebases that have well practiced coding principles, and modern technologies that can bring creative ideas to life.
