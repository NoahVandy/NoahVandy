### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me
My full name is **Noah Vandervelden** but I usually shorten it to Vandy so it's easier for people to remember ðŸ¤·. I am current a student at Grand Canyon University studying software development. This degree focuses not only on the coding aspect of development, but the design and agile components as well. Over the course of my college career, I have learned OOP through Java, C#, and PHP. Along with those languages, I have learned Java Spring, .NET MVC, and Laravel. I was taught design principles like UML class diagrams, system design, flowcharts, etc... 

I've had two Software Engineering internships. One was at a startup called Simplifyy, and the other was at a Forutne 500 company called Cerner. In these internships I learned how to communicate with a development team, how to participate in agile ceremonies, and contribute clean and effective code. Through Simplifyy I was taught React.js and Express.js, while at Cerner I was taught Ruby and Rails.

I love working with apps / websites that have a focus for UI/UX, codebases that have well practiced coding principles, and modern technologies that can bring creative ideas to life.

# Project Showcase
- [CollegeTrade](https://collegetrade.azurewebsites.net) - is my Senior Capstone. It is a virtual marketplace for students at Grand Canyon University to buy, sell, and trade things safely between other students. You need to have a GCU issued email in order to sign up and view listings other students have posted. Students can also set up different shops that contain specific types of listings they choose. This specific project uses the **MERN Stack** all hosted on **AWS**.
- CollegeTradeMobile - is an extention of my Senior Captsone. It uses the same API and Database, but uses **React-Native** as the front end, throwing me into the world of iOS/ Andriod development
- [TRP Productions](https://www.trp.productions) - a simple HTML website that I created for a friend's photography business.
